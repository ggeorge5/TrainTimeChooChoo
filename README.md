# TrainTimeChooChoo

For this assignment we were tasked with creating a train schedule. We have a user that creates a train name, the destination, when the first train arrives, and when the next will arrive. 

We had to utilize firebase to ensure that all of our data for each train EVER entered would be saved and not erased. 

We had to utilize the moment function within JS to mathematically formulate the difference between the current time and when the next train would be arriving. We also had to make it work to our local time.
